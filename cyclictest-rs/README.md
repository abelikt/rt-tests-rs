# Cyclictest written in Rust

The goal is to have a similar tool like cyclictest:

https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/howto/tools/cyclictest/start

See ../README.md for a introduction about why and why Rust is used here.

# State of implementation

* So far, it started to work and to show similar latencies like the original
cyclictest.
* The implementation is still limited to one thread and has no good reporting.
* Many places are still unsafe and can probably replaced

# Test System



# TODO

* Generate background load for tests
* Check multiple Platforms
